        <h1><b><u>The Coding Projects of Kai</u></b></h1>
        <p>This was the opening project of the year. Most of the code was already set up for us, but I added my take on it.</p>
        <a href="https://codepen.io/snoopy216/pen/jONxyYB"><p>Person Card</p></a>
        <p>I made some very satisfying hover effects cause I didn't know how to do very much else at the time, but it still looks cool. The fridge was a random idea that came into my head. </p> <a href="code-diddy.html">Fridge Project

        <p>This was the project I did as a proposal for how to redesign a room on the 14th floor. Fun fact about this project: Ms. Josephs will pitch the best proposals to the administration!

        <p>I started working on this project for fun. I actually made up the concept accidentally and went with it. I hope to add much more to this in the future.

        <p>This was a project we worked on in class where we had to utilize the mod function in Javascript and Scratch. Below is the end result as well as a description of how the two programs work:</p>

        <p>I began to learn about Javascript functions and how you can use Javascript to manipulate CSS code. These are my first steps:</p>

        <p>This is my big ocean project to present to the kindergarteners! I worked on this for a large chunk of the first half of the year. I really liked the idea of including different aquatic animals and plants from all different parts of the earth. Right now, this is unfinished.</p>

        <p>This was a project I made to learn about arrays. When you click on the money, a different word for money appears.</p>
