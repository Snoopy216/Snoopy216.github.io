		<h1><b>Person Card</b></h1>
		<p>This was the opening assignment of the year. We were given a functing bit of code and customized it as we wished. I had already made my github username Snoopy216 because I didn't realize they were usually our c names, so I figured it was only fair to make my person card all about Snoopy and Peanuts as well. I didn't start from scratch, but instead with a tempate where I would tweak and edit some of the porperties already written to modify the hover effects and image sizes. I changed color, sizing, and tranisitions.</p>

		<h1><b>Fridge Project</b></h1>
		<p>I made some very satisfying hover effects cause I didn't know how to do very much else at the time, but it still looks cool. This material was used in the opening demo to the class, but I added the border among other things. The fridge was a random idea that came into my head. I didn't really know what to do with it. I just used the div hover ability with transition.</p>

		<h1><b>Room Design</b></h1>
		<p>This was the project I did as a proposal for how to redesign a room on the 14th floor. I had to delete all of the white space from the images in order to allow viewers to see the background through the edges of the div. I also relearned how to push projects online. Fun fact about this project: Ms. Josephs will pitch the best proposals to the administration! Most of this was about getting the image sizing and less about the code. However, I did learn how to put all the images in an inline-block. (Side-by-side).</p>

		<h1><b>Hover Game</b></h1>
		<p>I started working on this project for fun. I experimented with other aspects of hover, and it is still a work in progress. I actually made up the concept accidentally and went with it. I hope to add more interactive divs in te same spirit to create a vast interactive experience! :) I like the idea of a bunch of hover puzzles combined.
        </p>

        <h1><b>Starting Ocean Project (Nov 4 - Nov 8)</b></h1>
        <p>This week I plan to start my ocean project. By the end of the week I aim to have one working location (for example: the Pacific Ocean). This will include a background, a fish representing you, and aquatic plants and animals to interact with. These plants and animals will change some combination of color and size when hovered over and will give information about themselves when clicked on.
        </p>

        <h1><b>Fizz Buzz</b></h1>
        <p>Fizz Buzz was a challenge based on the mod function and if else logic. I worked on it is class with Ryan by writing codes in Scratch and Javascript. I enjoyed it because it was a short break from the bigger projects. I liked the use of logic and I learned some about Javascript syntax. The goal was to list out the numbers but replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "Fizz Buzz." To do this, I would make the program count up through the numbers ("1,2,3,4...") and print them one by one. However, I would you if and else statements to replace multiples of 3 and 5 with Fizz, Buzz, or Fizz Buzz.</p>

        <h1><b>Albatross Cloning</b></h1>
		<p>I worked on this project in class. This was our introduction to Javascript, functions, and how to manipulate CSS code and divs with Javascript. The ability to create divs and make infinite albatrosses really broadened the things I could make with code. I really enjoyed this project. I ased the addEventListener "click" in order to know when the original albatross div was clicked. Then, when it was clicked, I used the create("div") function to make a new smaller version of the albatross. They were smaller because I could change the style using alba.style.height to modify the height of the div.</p>

		<h1><b>JS for Cats</b></h1>
		<p>JS for cats helped me understand functions better. This includes writing, calling, and editing them. Although we went over functions in class, I didn't fully understnad all of their uses, and this reading helped give me a more complete picture of the abilities of a function. It also helped me understand the importance of defining variables and then using them in called functions.</p>

		<h1><b>Ocean Project Part 1</b></h1>

        <p>This is my big ocean project to present to the kindergarteners! I worked on this for a large chunk of the first half of the year. I really liked the idea of including different aquatic animals and plants from all different parts of the earth. Right now, this is unfinished.</p>

        <h1><b>I Need A Raise</b></h1>

        <p>This was a project I made to learn about arrays. When you click on the money, a different word for money appears. I have a bunch of these various words for money in an array, and I use math.random to choose a random item from the array.</p>

        <h1><b>Cloning Perry and My Little Pony</b></h1>

        <p>This is a project I worked on with ELI and RYAN (be sure to give them credit for the assignment). 500 copies of an image of a my little pony holding up perry the platypus are created. They are created with randomly generated positions and sizes, and they move around the screen randomly too! I repeat the function makeSimba 300 times, and then use setinterval(simbaMove, 1000) to make the simba divs move every second.</p>

        <h1><b>What is going on in Ms. Josephs' food code sketch?</b></h1>

        <p>First, she has an event listener on the plate of food. When it is clicked on, it takes a random image of food from an array. That becomes the new food on the plate, and the other two circular divs for "What I think" and "What I feel" match their images to correspond to the one now on the plate.</p>
