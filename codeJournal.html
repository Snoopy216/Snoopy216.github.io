		<h1><b>Fridge Project</b></h1>
		<p>I made some very satisfying hover effects cause I didn't know how to do very much else at the time, but it still looks cool. This material was used in the opening demo to the class, but I added the border among other things. The fridge was a random idea that came into my head. I didn't really know what to do with it.</p>

		<h1><b>Room Design</b></h1>
		<p>This was the project I did as a proposal for how to redesign a room on the 14th floor. I had to delete all of the white space from the images in order to allow viewers to see the background through the edges of the div. I also relearned how to push projects online. Fun fact about this project: Ms. Josephs will pitch the best proposals to the administration!</p>

		<h1><b>Hover Game</b></h1>
		<p>I started working on this project for fun. I experimented with other aspects of hover, and it is still a work in progress. I actually made up the concept accidentally and went with it. I hope to add more interactive divs in te same spirit to create a vast interactive experience! :)
